Q1. the result variable in calculateSum function is a concatenated string as num1 and num2 are considered string object, but we want integer addition instead of string concatenation, so the result is not what we wanted and hence it is a bug.

Q2. I converted num1 and num2 into integers using Number() feature that converts an object to an integer, as shown in the screenshot.
