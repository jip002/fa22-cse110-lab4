Q1. values added: 20
Q2. final result: 20
Q3. values added: 20
Q4. it returns an error because we declared result with let keyword so the variable 'result' is only defined inside the code block, and it is not defined in line 13 which is outside of the code block.
Q5. it returns an error, because a const variable cannot be reassigned, so 'result = num1 + num2' is reassigning variable 'result' which is should be 0 all the time.
Q6. same as above, it causes error as const variable 'result' is reassigned which is not allowed to.
